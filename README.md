## Project Summary -

Despite encountering with two big World Wars,no one have ever imagined that this century would be called as most peaceful century. In 2021,the ressurgence of Taliban in South Asia had destabalized the region. Later on, the war between Russia and Ukraine also, have contributed for destabalizing the suo moto law and order situation. The accrual of all such events resulted in the formation of Global Terrorism Dataset.

Global Terrorism Dataset studies all such terror events occured since 1970. It studies various heads and provide brief information about the affected region, types of attacks, types of weapons, types of various targets and their sub types, number of kills and the extent of property damage etc.

The EDA project revolves around studying the various trends and inter-relations between these study heads. This project gives information about the trends revolving around the headed column on which the index have been studied by Institute of Economics and Peace. E.g It excavates the relations between the deep realtion between the affected region and any preferred attack type. Again the analysis digs the core information and works on questions like, is there any relation between the attacked Region and any preferred target type or preferred weapon type. By analysing such information countries and regions could analyse the very concentrated problem with which they are only affected.

World can expect such kind of efforts from, every keen and kind Data Enthusiast, which would generate the relevant insights regarding on going terror attacks. These steps would help countries inorder to formulate relevant policies and form better coalition,cooperation and implement those comprehensive steps in order to deal with terrorism.

This project summarise all the information and insights which could help countries to track the trends and correlation between terror attacks.

## Insights

>It has been found out that the Region Middle East and North Africa is most affected and enocountered with largest number of attacks.

>In the Second question, the Analysis have shown the total number of attacks experienced by individual countries.

>Countries like Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan and India are at the top of list with subsequent maximum number of attacks.

>1.Iraq - 24636\
2.Pakistan - 14368\
3.Afghanistan - 12731\
4.India - 11960

> Bombing and Explosions is one of attack types which have been used in highest number of attacks.\
It has been used in near about 30000 attacks.

>Private Properties are most affected target type.\
The Millitary targets are second most affected targets.\
In Private Properties the subtype Civillian encountered the highest number of attacks.\

>After that, In every region only Private Properties are most affected. Even in South Asia Private Properties are highly damaged by terror attacks.

>ISIS and Taliban are the most nototrious terrorist organisations. The ISIS alone have been involved in 22 % of terror attacks and Taliban alone involved\
in 17 %of all terror attacks.

>As weapons,Bombing weapons and Firearms are the most frequent weapons used by terrorists, in every attack type. E.g In Explosion and Assassination attack types, Bombing and firearms have been used most frequently.

>The number of people killed by these two most notorious weapons

>Firearms - 174894.0\
Explosives - 174277.0

>Due to Bombing and Explosions, Middle East and North Africa have experienced the death of near about 82000 people.Followed by South Asia with death of near about\ 42000 people.

>Due to Armed Assaults, South Asia have experienced near about 40000 deaths and Sub saharan region experienced near about 43000 deaths.

>Attacks in Private property encountered with 140K kills, which is the highest number.\
Military targets have encountered with 107K kills.\
Police targets have encountered with near about 54K kills.

>In property damage section , Minor type of infrastructure with monetary value less than one million dollar have been affected and damaged most.

## Recommendations

The Countries must work on comprehensive anti terro policies. Such Policies can be formulate in organisation like United Nations Securirty Councils.

In today's new World order multilateralism is appreciated by most of the regions and their respective countries. This new way of diplomacy could also be helpful for curbing the menace of terrorism.

Economy , Polity or Science could chnage with time and fluctuate but the Geography of countries never changed. If the same geography remained attached and aligned, where focus is on dissolving the boundries and not demarcating the boundries , problems like terrorism can never dominate over strong steadfast stature of countries.

So deep connection between countries, people to people relations , respecting each others foregn policy and not involving with any non state actors(for any kind of ill attack) will fetch countries strength and resilience to fight through any terror attacks.

## Conclusions

When Taliban took control of Afghanistan,whole world had felt the grief of Afghan people. Terrorism destroys the every right and batter the person unto his frightening death. In the above analysis , various study heads have been found out which could be easily studied by countries to curb the menace of terrorism.


## Terrorism do not just destroys the land but it destroys the peace,harmony, trust on humanity,the whole youth and cultivates the seeds of hatred and envy.
